		"description": "Advisors offer a pure futures business. Whether life counseling, investment counseling, couples counseling, legal counseling or other services in this area. The customer books the appointment by phone, email or via an appointment tool. Booking an appointment via an appointment tool is the most modern and time-saving way of booking. For both sides. The customer does not have to call, the consultant does not have to answer the phone. The customer books the appointment slot that is displayed to him and that suits him personally best. There is no need for lengthy, annoying appointments by email or phone.\nOften the consultant is in conversation with another client. Then only the answering machine and the recall remain. This works much better. And important questions can still be clarified after the online appointment booking. Via the Bookingflix chat tool or the old-fashioned way: by phone.",

		"description": "Customers now expect modern digital services. At the latest with the Corona pandemic, everyone has had experience with online appointment booking. And they were often pleasantly surprised at how quickly, easily and simply this worked. The customer clicks on the desired appointment, enters his or her name, email address and perhaps cell phone number. And the appointment is already reserved. The appointment can be confirmed manually by the service provider. Or fully automatically by the system. So the customer receives just-in-time the appointment confirmation after the appointment booking and appointment verification.\nThe separate appointment management and the entry in the appointment book or the appointment calendar is no longer necessary. Because with the booking and appointment confirmation all data is included in the personal dashboard of Bookingflix. Even a synchronization with the standard calendars of Microsoft, Apple and Google is possible. Thus, an immediate comparison of the appointment data is always guaranteed.\nBy the way, the customer can also manage the appointment online. Appointment changes, appointment cancellations or a query to the consultant. Everything is possible with just a few clicks via the personal appointment link and the customer login area. After the appointment, your visitors optionally receive an after-sale email. This email contains a link that leads the customers to a short online customer survey. This allows your customers to give an assessment of the advice they have received. This gives you valuable feedback and you can publish these evaluations, also optionally, on your website. This builds trust during subsequent consultations. Consultations via video conference are also possible. A video conferencing tool is already integrated at Bookingflix. So the booking customer receives directly with the email appointment confirmation the link to the video conference. The consultant sees the link listed in the dashboard. From there, he can also start the video conference.\nAppointment notes are a practical function for storing information about the various customers and the appointment. These can be found at the respective appointment and can be changed and created at any time.",
