Photographers, car repair shops, hairdressers, goldsmiths, opticians, glaziers, electronics technicians, bicycle repair shops, saddlers, tailors, confectioners, hearing aid technicians, dental technicians, cosmeticians, nail designers. The list of professions that are in constant contact with customers can be continued. All of them depend on making reliable appointments with their customers. What used to happen mostly by phone call is changing. Many trades rely on appointment coordination via appointment tools. The customer no longer has to call or leave a message on the answering machine. This is done with just a few clicks on the tradesman's website. Even on weekends, holidays or late at night, outside business hours.",

		"description": "Workshop customers appreciate it when everything simply runs smoothly. When placing an order with a craftsman or service provider, but also when making an appointment. Of course, many customers will still want to make their appointments by phone. But many customers, especially the younger ones, would prefer to do everything via smartphone. Appointment tools like Bookingflix make this possible in a very simple, efficient way. The customer sees when an appointment is free and books it with just a few clicks. The workshop has set the opening hours in advance. Vacations and vacations can also be defined. After booking, the customer manages his appointment completely independently. Changing and canceling appointments also takes just a few seconds with two or three clicks. And the integrated chat tool allows workshop, craftsman and customer to get in touch with each other.\nBooked appointments can be automatically synchronized with the standard Google, Apple and Microsoft calendars. So everyone is always up to date. By the way, appointments do not have to be confirmed manually. Bookingflix can be configured so that appointments are confirmed fully automatically by the system. Manual entry by the craftsman is also possible. In case a customer wants to book an appointment by phone.\nThe automatic appointment reminders by email and by SMS are also used with pleasure. So the customer can be reminded once or several times of the appointment, at specified times.\nIf different services are offered, these can also be offered via the appointment booking calendar. The customer then first selects the desired service. This can differ in terms of title, duration and price. After the selection he chooses the preferred appointment time and books the appointment. In this way, the craftsman immediately sees which service has been booked.",
