		"description": "Digitalisation is also making significant progress in the town hall. In the citizens' office, residents can access almost all services in one place. Some services can even be accessed online from home.\nFor everything else, either a waiting mark is drawn on the spot or an appointment is made in advance. More and more town halls now offer this appointment service via an appointment tool. The citizen can book the desired appointment online at any time, provided it is still free. Appointments that have already been booked are therefore no longer offered and are only automatically released again if they are cancelled.",

	"sub": {
		"description": "Citizens now expect a modern, service-oriented city hall. A telephone hotline is not always the best offer here. Especially not if you have to wait in a queue for a simple inquiry or to make an appointment. Or the responsible official is \"not at his desk but will gladly call you back if you leave a message on the answering machine. Appointment tools are much more customer-friendly and effective for making appointments. For both sides. That is, for citizens and for the citizens' bureau. The citizen books the desired free appointment at home on the PC or with the smartphone. The appointment request is automatically confirmed by Bookingflix. Or alternatively manually by the responsible clerk. Important information can be communicated directly during the booking. Or additionally via the appointment confirmation by email. Because this can be set, like almost everything at Bookingflix, individually and flexibly. The citizen receives his own appointment link, through which the appointment can be managed. The appointment can be changed or canceled. The clerk can be reached via a chat tool. In case of new messages, pages are informed by email. The chat history is saved, but can also be deleted. Before the appointment, the citizen can be reminded of the appointment once again by email or SMS. This increases the appointment reliability significantly. The appointment booking calendar for fixed opening hours can be set individually, depending on the opening time or other free days. If multiple appointment booking calendars are needed, this can be expanded without limit.\nBookingflix was developed in Germany, taking into account the DSGVO. All servers are stationed in Germany. All appointment data will be deleted automatically after 30 days. However, if necessary, they can be backed up in advance.",
