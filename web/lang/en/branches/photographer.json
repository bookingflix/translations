		"description": "Photography is for the most part a deadline business. Family pictures, job application portraits, wedding photos or daycare pictures. Almost every photographer or photo studio depends on a reliable appointment. In the past, this was mostly done by email and phone. Today, more and more photographers rely on appointment tools. By the way, the first user of Bookingflix was a photographer or a photo agency. For the weekly test shoots and castings, they were looking for an appointment tool that was easy to use and reminded the models of the agreed appointment via email and SMS. Bookingflix has been in use here for years. To see on Foto-Agentur.de.\nWith these first user experiences, Bookingflix was subsequently further expanded and optimized. And meanwhile many more photographers and photo studios use Bookingflix for the uncomplicated, fast and reliable appointment by click. And at the appointment in the studio or on-location, the camera then clicks.",

		"description": "Photographers use Bookingflix for very different purposes or business models. There is the Foto-Agentur.de already mentioned above. Here it is about individual events in different cities. For each city, a separate date-booking calendar is available. The models can select the desired calendar and then the preferred date. If an appointment is already fully booked, it is not even displayed. After booking, the organizer is informed and can manually confirm the appointment or send a cancellation. Models manage their appointment independently via a personal appointment link. This means that they can change the appointment or cancel it. An email to the organizer can also be sent via the integrated chat tool. After the appointment, each model receives an after-sale link with a request to rate the shoot. So over the past years the service and the shootings of Foto-Agentur.de, could be improved more and more. The main reason for using an appointment tool was the significant time saving. What used to be an eternal email ping-pong has now given way to automation: Book appointment, send commitment, appointment takes place. Or book appointment, send commitment, appointment cancellation by customer, re-book appointment, appointment takes place. Simple and effective. Also for the models.\n\nOther photographers operate a stationary photo studio. Xrawstudios.com, for example, specializes in children's photo parties as well as renting out the space. Both services can be booked through the website. Here, too, the ratings of previous customers come into play, who have written reviews after their shoots. These are displayed directly on the appointment booking calendar, which has a significant impact on the trust factor. An appointment tool is almost a must, especially for service providers who are not open throughout the day or are not always available by phone. This is because it allows customers to book at any time. Even if the photographer is shooting a wedding or is on vacation.",
