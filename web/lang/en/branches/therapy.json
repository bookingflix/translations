		"description": "Alternative practitioners and providers of naturopathic therapies were among the first users to discover Bookingfix for themselves and their customers. The ease of making appointments and the uncomplicated setup suited many practices. Define opening hours, customize appointment booking form, publish appointment booking calendar. And already the patients and customers can book an appointment. Of course, not everyone wants them. But booking by phone is still open to patients. But more and more, Bookingflix users tell us, prefer booking by appointment tool. The load of daily incoming callers can thus be significantly reduced. It's more relaxed for everyone.",

		"description": "Data protection in the medical field is of paramount importance, and quite rightly so.This is why sensitive data is not usually requested when making appointments. When booking appointments, hardly more than the name and email address is needed. In addition, the servers of Bookingflix are located in Germany. So data are not transferred or stored in non-European countries. All data is secured by modern encryption technology. Backups of the appointment data are automatically saved several times a day, on separate servers. The data deletion period is 30 days. However, earlier deletion is also possible. If the data is still needed, it can be downloaded in PDF and CSV format.\nBookingflix was already developed strictly according to the European DSGVO regulation during the development. Because the data must be secure. This is also what patients expect.\nWhen creating an appointment booking calendar, different calendar types can be set up. For example, an appointment-booking calendar for fixed opening hours or for specific events. If appointments are only offered at a few, already fixed times, it is recommended to use the calendar for concrete events. If appointments are offered on several days each week, the calendar can be used for fixed opening hours. Here, break times, days off and vacations can also be taken into account.\nOptionally, patients and customers are reminded of the appointment by email and SMS. A manual entry of the appointment, for example, if a patient has no internet access, is also possible. The practice then takes over the appointment entry. Booked appointments are only shown as free again if the patient changes or cancels the appointment. Very short appointment slots, for example only five or 10 minutes, are also possible.",
