		"description": "\nIt's hard to make a phone call with a tattoo machine in your hand. More and more tattoo artists are noticing this. The customer wants to book an appointment for an info session or a follow-up appointment. This is much easier with the appointment tool. The customer selects the desired date and enters the necessary contact data. The e-mail address and name are usually sufficient for this. The arrangement by telephone is no longer necessary. Especially the young target group of the tattoo fan, does prefer all with the smartphone. Thus, also the online booking of an appointment.",

		"description": "For many, booking appointments online is a must-have. This is true for customers but also for service providers and organizers who offer appointments. It is so convenient and saves time. A big advantage is the customer's own management of the appointment. Appointment arrangement, appointment change and appointment cancellation is completely done by the customer. The service provider simply specifies when appointments should be bookable. The customer then books the desired appointment slot. The appointment management is then independently manageable for the customer via the personal appointment link. The appointments can be synchronized with the standard Google, Apple and Microsoft calendar. In this way, appointments that are already occupied are blocked. And new appointments appear on the service provider's own smartphone. Free days and vacations can be set in the dashboard. So that customers cannot book appointments on these days. The integration of the appointment booking calendar is very simple. Via a HTML embed code the Bookingflix booking calendar can be integrated on the own website. Alternatively, a micro-booking website is created with each booking calendar. This can be customized. This way, service providers without their own website can also offer online appointment booking. Appointment reminders via email and SMS are also popular. This significantly increases appointment reliability. Or, to put it another way, the no-show rate drops.\nThe appointment reminders can be customized in terms of content and sending time.",
