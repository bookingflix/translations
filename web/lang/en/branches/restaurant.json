		"description": "During the Corona pandemic, restaurants and pubs could also only be visited with an appointment. Later, even only with a test or vaccination card. As annoying as this was for many. So simple and uncomplicated many inns could offer this for their customers. However, booking tables is also a popular instrument for customer loyalty and customer acquisition beyond the pandemic. Customers who want to book a table quickly can do so with just a few clicks. For this, many restaurants have basically connected a few tables with Bookingflix. Means, these can be booked online preferentially. Only if all other tables are already taken, these \"Bookingflix tables\" can also be booked by phone.\nRegular customers even like to book by appointment tool. This the landlord, the waiter, the waitress can even draw attention to this table booking service.",

		"description": "Some customers are reluctant to book a table by phone. They also order pizza or duck with rice by smartphone and app. So they are used to this service. Therefore, they also want to book the table by online booking tool.\nTherefore, more and more restaurants and pubs use Bookingflix to make free tables bookable.\nThe setup is very simple. Via Bookingflix's QuickStart, the restaurant defines how many tables can be booked online and during which opening hours they can be booked.\nBy embedding code, the appointment booking calendar is then published on the restaurant's own website. The guest then only has to select the date, enter his name and email address. And already the inn can also take reservations online. From new customers and regular customers. And if the table was already assigned by telephone, this can be entered with a few clicks on Bookingflix. So it also does not come to overbookings.\nThe appointment reminders via SMS and email are also popular. Thus, the guests are reminded in advance once again of the booked table. The guest can then change or cancel the appointment in good time, if necessary.\nVia the dashboard, all appointment or table bookings are clearly listed by day and time. Reservations can also be entered manually for the guest. Some restaurants only use Bookingflix. For the online table booking but also for the entry of telephone reservations.",
