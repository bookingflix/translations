		"description": "Those who never booked an appointment through an appointment tool before 2020 may not have known it existed. Then, starting in 2021, countless immunization and testing centers opened across the country. The demand for powerful appointment tools that run stably even when crowded increased sharply. Bookingflix has also been used in many testing and immunization centers since then. Some new functions were even implemented especially for this purpose. For example, the check-in and check-out system via QR code scan.\nThis strongly increased demand also led to the fact that Bookingflix since then runs on a powerful server structure of the world market leader AWS. And this very stable, even under high load.\nThe end customer, or affectionately known as the vaccinator, wants to quickly and easily select and book the desired date. And if a vaccination is possible more quickly, for example spontaneously at the family doctor's, the already booked appointment can be canceled without writing an email or making a phone call.\nData security and data protection naturally play a special role in this sensitive area. Even if it is mainly about appointment data, any data in the health service, are of particular relevance. Here Bookingflix could prove itself as a reliable partner of medical practices, test centers and vaccination centers. With a certain pride, the team of Bookingflix can claim to have been a little bit involved in the fight against the pandemic.",

		"description": "As already described, the end customer, the vaccinated person, wants to get to the desired vaccination or test appointment without long waits, without calling, without waiting on hold, without busy lines.\nUsing the appointment booking calendar, the customer selects the desired appointment, enters his or her data and confirms the privacy conditions. After verification, the appointment is confirmed directly by the system or can be confirmed manually by the vaccination or testing center with one click. The customer receives the appointment confirmation with the personal appointment link by email. The booking can be edited or cancelled via this link. The appointment ticket with QR code is also available there. Using the QR code, the team from the vaccination or testing center can document attendance. For billing or traceability, this is a practical or even necessary function.\nGroup appointments can even be set. This was an urgent request from a vaccination center so that couples can also attend vaccination together and do not have to book appointments that are far apart.\nThe appointment slots can be set individually. Even short appointments of five minutes can be preset.\nThe address of the vaccination center or the test center can be displayed directly in the appointment booking calendar. This even includes a link to Google Maps.\nAnd if a vaccinated person has problems with the Internet, an appointment can be quickly entered by hand for the vaccinated person.",
