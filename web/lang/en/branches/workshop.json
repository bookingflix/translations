		"description": "The large workshops with many branches now almost all offer online appointment booking. This is because customers insist on such digital services. More and more small workshops are also including appointment-booking calendars on their websites. Because it's so convenient. The customer goes to the workshop's website and books the desired appointment. The service required can be selected directly as an option. That way, the team on site knows what work is due on the day in question. Change a tire, repair or replace a windshield, change the oil, do a chip tune-up, have the vehicle inspected by the TÃœV or have an inspection.",

		"description": "Workshop customers appreciate it when everything simply runs smoothly. With the car and with the appointment. Of course, many customers will still want to make their appointment by phone. But many customers, especially the younger ones, would prefer to do everything via smartphone. Appointment tools like Bookingflix make this possible in a very straightforward way. The customer sees when an appointment is free and books it with just a few clicks. The workshop has set the opening hours in advance. Vacations and vacations can also be defined. After booking, the customer manages his appointment independently. Appointment changes and cancellations can also be made in seconds with just a few clicks. And the integrated chat tool allows workshop and car owner to get in touch with each other.\nBooked appointments can be automatically synchronized with the standard Google, Apple and Microsoft calendars. So everyone is always up to date. By the way, appointments do not have to be confirmed manually. Bookingflix can be configured so that appointments are confirmed fully automatically by the system. Manual entry by the workshop is also possible. In case a customer wants to book an appointment by phone.\nThe automatic appointment reminders by email and by SMS are also used with pleasure. In this way, the customer can be reminded once or several times of the appointment, at specified times.\nIf different services are offered, these can also be offered via the appointment booking calendar. The customer then selects the desired service first. For example, oil change or inspection. This service can differ in terms of title, duration and price. After the selection, he chooses the preferred appointment time and books the appointment. In this way, the craftsman immediately sees which service has been booked.",
