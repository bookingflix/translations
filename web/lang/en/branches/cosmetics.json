		"description": "Regular customers in particular love booking appointments via an online appointment tool. They know what to expect and what service they want. Only the new appointment is still missing for wellness and beauty happiness. Here, beauty and cosmetic salons, massage studios and other wellness providers can very well inform and guide their regular customers. Often already a small reference or info. note is sufficient. Or at the reception the first reservation via date booking calendar is simply made together. The next time, the customer can then do this alone at home.\nExperience shows that people prefer to book more often via appointment tools. Because it is easier and the booking can also be made outside business hours. And many customers now even choose their service provider on the basis of whether it offers such a digital appointment booking service. The time saved is another important argument for both customer and service provider. It only takes about a minute to book the appointment. The telephone can hardly keep up with that. Above all, it costs time again if the answering machine comes on first because no employee has time to answer the phone at the moment. This even annoys customers if it happens more often. They would like to have only one date. They can book it easily with Bookingflix.",

		"description": "Online appointment booking is becoming more and more of a must-have. Many modern, Internet-savvy customers appreciate the fast, uncomplicated option of online booking.\nThey see on the website of your beautician, massage institute or wellness provider when an appointment is free, select the desired service and click on BOOK NOW. By clicking on the link in the verification email, the appointment is firmly booked. Optionally, the customer can still be reminded of the appointment by email or SMS. Here, the text in the reminder email and the time can be freely selected.\nAnd if Ms. Meier, who has no Internet or cell phone, needs an appointment? Then she still calls, of course. The team can enter the appointment in the login area with just a few clicks. Just as if Ms. Meier had booked the appointment herself. This has the advantage that the appointment slot cannot be assigned twice. And if several colleagues are on duty at the same time, this can be taken into account in the appointment booking calendar. It can even be set so that the customer selects her preferred beautician when booking. Either each employee receives their own appointment booking calendar. This can even be managed by respective colleagues via rights management. Or in the appointment booking form, the customer selects which colleague she prefers. This can then, as far as possible, be taken into account during planning and on site. Of course, it can happen that an appointment has to be canceled. This can be done by the customer with just two clicks. The appointment slot is then immediately released. Or the customer calls about the cancellation and the team in the beauty studio does the cancellation quickly and easily in the dashboard of Bookingflix.\nNone of this is complicated, nor is it witchcraft. It's modern, digital and customer-friendly.",
