		"description": "Insurance companies use Bookingflix for sales and new customer acquisition as well as for making appointments with their existing customers.\nFor new customer acquisition, the agent sends the link to the appointment booking calendar to potential new customers as part of a mailing or info mail.\nAlso on brochures or on business cards the link to the Bookingflix calendar should be printed. This gives the customer another channel to contact the insurance representative or make an appointment. And an appointment is still the gold standard for a successful conclusion. Existing customers also need an appointment with their insurance office in the event of a claim or if they need new coverage. With just a few clicks, customers can book a free appointment slot and then manage it themselves. Changes and cancellations of appointments do not have to be discussed on the phone. This saves time for both the policyholder and the insurance provider.",

		"description": "Acquiring new customers is a challenge for professionals. It's all about trust and as many, different points of contact as possible. That can be a write-off, an email, a phone call, an ad in the zietung, positive reviews and recommendations. It can also be making it as easy and quick as possible to book an appointment. The customer sees the advertisement of the insurance office and urgently needs an appointment for a new insurance. However, he is very reluctant to make a phone call. And yes, that does exist. In fact, it's on the rise. Many young people only make phone calls when there's really no other way. If possible, they do everything online. Of course, that includes booking appointments online with their smartphones. Here, an insurance office that offers online appointment booking via an appointment tool has a real competitive advantage.\nThe customer clicks on the free desired appointment, enters the customer data and the appointment is booked. Even the appointment confirmation is sent, optionally and immediately, by Bookingflix. No waiting in the queue. No tuning possible appointment options, no discussing an answering machine. There are customers who don't do that. These customers prefer to book an appointment with the competition.\nThe customer also takes over the administration of the booked appointment completely. A change or cancellation of the appointment can be necessary in the hectic everyday life from time to time. To do this, the customer no longer has to call or write an email. Using the personal appointment link, changing or canceling an appointment is a matter of seconds. The appointment reminder by handwritten email or by phone call is also omitted for the insurance office. Bookingflix does it automatically at predefined times. And if several colleagues need their own appointment booking calendar, this can be set up quickly. Optionally usable with a rights management. So that only the appointment data are visible, which were released, respectively are relevant.\nThe appointment booking calendar can be integrated into your own website. Alternatively, an independent micro website is generated with each appointment booking calendar. This contains the booking calendar and can be customized. The link is then only sent to the customer, who can book an appointment directly on the website.\nIn addition to accessibility, trust is a great value for insurance companies and their customers. Therefore, an after-sale email can be sent to the customer after the appointment. In this, an evaluation is requested fully automatically. This can be given by the customer in the form of a text review as well as a star rating.\nOptionally, the Bookingflix calendar can be synchronized with the standard Google, Apple and Microsoft calendar. This synchronization works in both directions. Thus, the agent can view new appointments that have been booked via Bookingflix. This synchronizes immediately and fully automatically. But the other direction is also possible. Entered appointments in Google and Microsoft calendar are transferred to Bookingflix. Not the content or customer data of the appointment. Only the appointment times. Through this, these appointment times are blocked in the Bookingflix calendar. So if the agent has already entered an appointment in his smartphone calendar, this appointment slot will be blocked in the Bookingflix calendar immediately.",
