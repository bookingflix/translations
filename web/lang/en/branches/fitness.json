		"description": "During the Corona pandemic, gyms were also only allowed to be visited with an appointment. Later, even only with a test or vaccination card. As annoying as this was for many people. Many fitness studios were able to offer this to their customers in a simple and uncomplicated way. Making appointments by phone quickly proved to be too time-consuming, as there were simply too many calls in a short time. Larger studios in particular would have had to set up an additional telephone hotline. That's why many studios started using appointment booking tools. The athlete only had to specify when he wanted to train. The booking system then automatically confirmed the appointment. After the visit with appointment was then no longer necessary, many studios deleted their appointment booking calendars at Bookingflix again. But many have also stayed with it. At least regarding some special services. Courses or individual consultations could still be booked via the fitness studio's website. And the athletes got used to it. What seemed annoying at first was then almost missed. The individual appointment booking in the fitness studio.",

		"description": "Of course, visiting the gym should be possible without an appointment. But some individual services can be offered separately using the appointment booking tool. For example, courses, training advice, trial training or personal training with your own personal trainer.\nThe personal trainer creates for example an appointment booking calendar on Bookingflix. He defines when a training can be booked. Which days are free and how long a training lasts. The setting options are very extensive but at the same time very easy to set. Because about the QuickStart can be generated, step by step, the required appointment booking calendar. And with the integration code then integrate on their own website. Or alternatively you can use the micro website of Bookingflix. Then it goes even completely without own Website.\nThe customer, the sportswoman then clicks on the desired appointment slot and enters the required data. Often, the name and email address are sufficient. The studio or the trainer then sends the appointment confirmation manually or fully automatically via the Bookingflix system. The athlete receives the appointment confirmation immediately.\nAlso concrete events can be offered and then booked via Bookingflix. You can create different training events. For example courses at fixed times. These can then be booked by a certain number of athletes. If the event is fully booked, no further booking is possible. Unless someone cancels. This can be done with two clicks on the personal appointment link. The date is then free again and someone else can book the date. The appointment booking calendar of Bookingflix can also be synchronized with the standard calendars of Google, Apple and Microsoft. So the trainer can also see in his smartphone calendar which appointments are booked. And already entered appointments are transferred to Bookingflix, These appointment slots are thus blocked. This is a 2-way synchronization.\nCustomers also appreciate the automatic appointment reminders via SMS and via email. These can be set individually and deactivated by both sides, i.e. also by the customers, if not desired.",
