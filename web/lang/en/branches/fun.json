		"description": "In this industry in particular, the average age is relatively young. And the younger generation is used to organizing their lives using smartphones, apps and the Internet. There is a large proportion in this group who only reach for the phone to make a call in an absolute emergency. The phone or smartphone is mainly used for entertainment and organization. For communication, too, of course. But messenger and social web services dominate here. This rather young generation therefore does not want to make an appointment by phone. They want to surf to a service provider's website, select the appointment and book it quickly and easily. So whoever is convincing as a service provider here. Digitally convincing. They have a real advantage.",

		"description": "The use cases are so diverse that a list can only be incomplete.\nAmusement parks, sports parks, climbing parks, concerts, theaters, cinemas, drive-in cinemas, zoos, wildlife parks, mini-golf courses, escape rooms, leisure centers, indoor skiing, boat rentals, event gastronomy, excursion organizers, open-air events. Everywhere tickets are booked or appointments are made.\nThe customer wants to click on the desired service online and book it immediately. The moment the appointment is confirmed is a moment of inner satisfaction. Like buying or owning a long cherished desire. Bookingflix offers a powerful, customizable appointment tool that meets this need. The appointment is confirmed immediately. If necessary, it can be changed or cancelled later. Important information can be communicated to the customer via chat function.\nThe appointment confirmation can be easily transferred to the standard calendar of the smartphone. In addition, the appointment confirmation contains a PDF ticket with QR code. This can be printed out or presented digitally at the entrance. Using the QR code, the event organizer can check the customer in and also check them out again when they leave the event.\nAppointment bookings can be confirmed automatically by Bookingflix. In case of a cancellation, the appointment slot is immediately released again. Group bookings, with a predefined maximum group size, can also be set up very easily.\nWhen creating the appointment booking calendar, you can set the regular opening, break and vacation times. If the event is held only once or a few times a year, we recommend using the appointment-booking calendar for specific events. The maximum number of participants can be set.\nThe appointment management can also be handed over to an employee. An extensive rights management is available for this purpose.\nIf the event data is to be processed further, it can be downloaded and imported in just a few seconds. For example, into Excel or into a CRM.\nReduce the NoShow rate significantly. Simply send customers a reminder by email or by SMS at self-defined times. Better a customer who cancels than a customer who doesn't show up anyway.",
