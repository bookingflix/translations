		"description": "In the Corona pandemic, many organizers had to offer appointments. Free access was no longer possible without booking an appointment in advance. Other museums and exhibition organizers have been offering ticketing to their customers for some time. All of them have in common the desire to offer the ticket, the appointment, as easy as possible to their customers. Currently Bookingflix is not yet connected to a payment service. This function is expected at the end of 2022. But for the simple booking of appointments and tickets, without collecting a payment, Bookingflix can already be used in many cases.",

		"description": "The interested museum or exhibition visitor selects the desired date, enters his data and books the appointment. The verification email follows and then the confirmation email. The ticket with all appointment information is also available via this email. There is also a QR code for check-in at the entrance. A big advantage of booking through Bookingflix is the fully automated booking process. Even the appointment confirmation of the successful booking can be sent automatically by the system. Alternatively, this can also be done manually, after checking the booking. The appointment reminders are also sent automatically via email and SMS. This significantly increases the reliability of appointments. Most customers really appreciate this digital service. And optionally, the reminders can be turned off: by you but also by your customers. Also optional: After the appointment, after the event, your visitors receive an after-sale email. This email lists a link that takes customers to a short online customer survey. This allows your customers to submit an evaluation. This gives you valuable feedback and allows you to publish these reviews on your website. This boosts confidence in subsequent bookings.",
