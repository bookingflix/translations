This way all email related appointment confirmations, appointment cancellations and appointment reminders will be routed through your mailbox. Your customers will see your email address as sender.\n\nWe recommend this feature for service providers who schedule many appointments via Bookingflix.com. This way you can handle the issue of \"spam problems when sending emails\" on your own. Username, password, etc. you get from your email provider, domain administrator or webmaster.\n\nFor technical reasons the SMTP access data incl. password must be stored in our database. The password must be sent along with the server connection to the email server, this excludes an encryption of the password. Therefore please use an extra mailbox especially for Bookingflix e.g. terminbenachrichtigung@firma-xyz.de with a one-time used password which is as secure as possible. No other mail traffic should be handled in the used mailbox. Furthermore we recommend to change the access password regularly e.g. every 4 weeks and to store it new on Bookingflix.\n\nAfter saving the SMTP access data the email dispatch will be started directly via your mail server. You are responsible for the stability and accessibility of your mail server. We have no influence on it and can not take over any support / warranty. Please consult your email provider / administrator in advance about the permissibility and capacity estimates of mass emails and possible monitoring / restrictions in this regard (e.g. spam filters, etc.). \n\nBasically it is possible for you to stop this procedure at any time and have the email dispatch handled by the Bookingflix mail server again.

		"Technisches-114": {
			"answer": "Bookingflix currently offers two variants of embedding: JAVASCRIPT and IFRAME. The IFRAME technology creates a window on the customer's website. Via this window you can display the appointment calendar. In this case the appointment calendar is calculated and graphically prepared on the Bookingflix server. The website of the customer as well as the generated calendar have no direct contact, but are quasi separated by a \"virtual glass pane\". Thus, the style specifications of the customer's website cannot influence the appointment calendar display, at most the design of the window frame. \nThe second variant is JAVASCRIPT. Here the calendar is created directly on the customer's website. The source code is directly connected to the customer's website. Style specifications of the customer can have an influence. This allows to override e.g. colors, layout and fonts.\n\nNormally we recommend the JAVASCRIPT code, because e.g. the sometimes disturbing \"window frame\" (iframe) is omitted and it has some other technical advantages. But if the design is negatively influenced by your own website style sheets, then you either have to adjust the website style sheets a bit to keep the calendar out - or you create special style sheets for the calendar in CSS - or you use the IFRAME technology.",

		"Terminbuchung-45": {
			"answer": "Once an appointment has been booked and confirmed, the appointment slot is no longer available. If several appointments are available per appointment slot, one slot will be blocked. If a booked appointment has not yet been verified by the customer (by clicking on the verification link), the appointment will also remain blocked until the verification period expires. However, the appointment that has not yet been verified will not appear in your dashboard until the customer has verified it. This prevents overbooking of the appointment slot. When an appointment is canceled, the appointment slot is automatically and immediately unblocked and can be re-booked. When manually entering appointments, you can check whether an appointment has already been deposited and an overbooking is imminent.",

For this purpose we use a dispatch mechanism via different relay pools on German servers to avoid black-listing. Furthermore Bookingflix has a more extensive analysis tool in use, which monitors the outgoing emails. Thereby we can get hints why an email did not arrive in a particular case.\n\nIf appointment reminders do not arrive, it could have other causes, regardless of the sending mechanism. Each email to be sent goes through several complex tests before it is sent.\n\nHere are some possible scenarios:\n\n1. Could it perhaps be that the emails have ended up in your customers' spam folder? We have no influence on the spam policies of the mail accounts.\n\n2. Customers book an appointment that starts in 3 hours. The appointment reminder is set for 24 hours before the appointment. In this case, of course, no appointment reminder is sent, because it would be already overdue for sending the appointment form.\n\n3. An appointment reminder is ready to be sent, but the email address has not been verified yet. Even then, no appointment reminders will be sent.\n\n4. The email address must be different from the email address of your account and from the contact email address that you may have entered in the calendar wizard.
