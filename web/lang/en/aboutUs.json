		"description": "We want to grow slowly but steadily without having to engage in aggressive marketing to do so. We generate growth through positive user experience. This is relevant for our clients. But also for the end customers who book an appointment. We welcome competition as another driver. We have the clear goal to offer a tool that is easier to use, more flexible and cheaper than comparable tools.\n\nData protection according to GDPR and data security are prioritized and considered during development. The further development never ends.\n\nWe personally value our employees and the freelancers involved. It is important to us that everyone feels comfortable, enjoys their work and is motivated to work together to achieve the agreed goals.",

		"description": "The goal was and is to develop a reliably functioning appointment tool for small and large service providers. The focus is on simple usability as well as flexible use. We develop new features thanks to feedback from our customers and users. We meet them as partners, with whose help we agilely optimize Bookingflix.\n\nWe try to make Bookingflix a little better every day. Positive feedback motivates us. Negative feedback drives us. We see personal support as an important tool to get new suggestions and to fix mistakes. We consider mistakes as a necessary learning experience",
