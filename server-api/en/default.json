This saves time for all parties, as you will only receive one invoice per year. You can still cancel on a monthly basis. If you cancel early, you will of course be refunded any overpayments immediately. We are flix, we are fair.\n\nYou can also use the free account. This will be activated automatically in the next few days. Your Premium account will be deactivated. However, your customers will then only be able to book a total of 12 appointments per month with a maximum advance booking period of 7 days. Only one booking calendar can be used per account (calendars created in excess will be deactivated. Please save appointment data if necessary). And the booking period for your customers is limited.\n\nThe Premium account can be extended easily by direct debit. Below are the payment plans. Alternatively, you can also pay by invoice (see below). In either case, you will receive an invoice by post. If you have any questions or problems: support@bookingflix.com or 02302-4007736.\n\nPremium payment plans (please click): \n---\nAccessible via https://bookingflix.com/dashboard/premium.html\n\nPLEASE FIRST LOG IN TO YOUR BOOKINGFLIX ACCOUNT VIA:\nhttps://bookingflix.com/de/sign-in.html\n\nAlternative payment by purchase on account (please only for annual billing):\n---\nYou can also pay by invoice and renew your Premium account. Please contact us by email (support@bookingflix.com) if you prefer to pay by invoice (only annual billing possible with purchase on account).\n\nThree booking calendars are already included in Premium. So if you would like to use a fourth or fifth calendar, please order these via the payment plans.\n\nExample: If you require the Premium account with four calendars, please order the Premium direct debit plan and the plan for an additional calendar separately.\n\nPlease contact us if you require additional booking calendars. We can activate these at any time at short notice.\n\nHere is an overview of all services and prices:\n---\n- https://bookingflix.de/features\n- https://bookingflix.de/prices\n\nThe Premium account you are currently using will therefore cost you a fee per month in future. For this you have daily, personal support, unlimited appointment bookings, three calendars included, just-in-time backup support. Even after the pandemic, Bookingflix will continue to support you with appointment shopping, booking consulting appointments and other future tools for the retail and service sectors. We will bundle these services in the premium account.\n\nYours sincerely\nMarcus Hanke\n\nTeam Bookingflix.com\nBebelstr. 15\n58453 Witten\nEmail: support@bookingflix.com\nPhone: 0176 - 415 891 84",

	"welcomeLetter": "Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,\n\nwir freuen uns über Ihr Interesse, Bookingflix.com zu nutzen. Nutzen Sie das Online-Termintool, um mit Kunden und Geschäftspartnern, schnell, einfach und online, Termine zu vereinbaren. Zeit sparen und nervigen Telefon-Stress für alle minimieren.\n\nHinweis zum Testen von Bookingflix:\n---\nNutzen Sie bitte verschiedene Endgeräte. Wenn Sie eingeloggt sind im Login-Bereich (Dashboard) und gleichzeitig mit dem selben Endgerät einen Termin buchen, kann es zu Fehlern kommen. Dies betrifft aber nur den Versand der Terminbestätigungen. Daher bitte die Test-Buchung mit einem anderen Gerät durchführen, mit dem Sie nicht in Bookingflix eingeloggt sind. Geben Sie auch eine andere Emailadresse bei der Buchung an als die, die Sie beim Einrichten des Bookingflix-Accounts verwendet haben. So ist eine realistische Testumgebung gewährleistet.\n\n---\nBei Fragen, Problem, Wünschen oder Anregungen bitte gerne melden. Wir sind sehr an einem Austausch und einer Verbesserung von Bookingflix interessiert.\n---\n\nMit Bookingflix sind Sie übrigens auf der sicheren Seite. \nDer Server-Standort ist Frankfurt am Main in Deutschland, mehrere Backups am Tag, HTTPS-Verschlüsselung, Terminvereinbarungs-Prozess bereits nach DSGVO-Standard umgesetzt.

Es erfolgt KEINE automatische Verlängerung.\n\n\nTipps für den erfolgreichen Start:\n---\nFür die meisten der nachfolgenden Einstellungen benötigen Sie einen Bookingflix-Account über https://bookingflix.com/sign-in.html/\n\nHier alle Hilfe-Videos zu den Bookingflix-Funktionen: \nhttps://bookingflix.de/support/videos\n\nTerminformular über Quick-Start anlegen: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/quickstart.html\n\nRegistrieren und Einloggen: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/sign-in.html\n\nProfil-Infos ausfüllen: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/user/profile.html\n\nvorhandenes Terminformular bearbeiten: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/calendars/all.html\n\nTerminformular veröffentlichen: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/publish/all.html\n\nQR-Code ausdrucken, damit Kunden noch schneller einen Termin buchen können: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/qr-code/all.html\n\nFreie Tage, Urlaube einstellen: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/holidays.html\n\nTermin-Buchungs-Website einrichten und nutzen (eine Alternative zum Einbinden des Terminformulars auf der eigenen Website)\n\nTerminerinnerungen einrichten: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/reminder/all.html\n\nBenachrichtigungs-Texte (Emails an Kunden) bearbeiten: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/defaultMessages/all.html\n\nDatenverarbeitungsvertrag anfordern falls benötigt: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/dataprocessing-contract.html\n\nWeitere Einstellungs-Optionen auf: \nhttps://bookingflix.com/dashboard/settings.html\n\n---\n\nSie können übrigens jedes bereits erstellte Termin-Formular individuell bearbeiten.
